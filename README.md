# Astroids-Box2D
Something small I made to practice with box2D. An astroids clone with realistic phisics. Control the ship with the arrow keys and shoot with the spacebar. 
Spawn new astroids by left clicking with the mouse. Enjoy! ;)

# Installation
Download the zip file and unpack it.

Open the solution file with Visual Studio.

Right click on the solution in the solution explorer and press build.

Right click on the project in the solution explorer -> debug -> start new instance.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Or download the executable together with the SDL2.dll. Both files should be in the same folder.
